Hey! This is a small Discord bot that I used to get started with this kind of stuff. Feel free to take a look around, use all or part of my code if you want.

I originally used the bot to spam ping my friends (to break ping records), and tested a NLP library with it (present in code, but commented out), but abandoned it because it was far too inaccurate.
